* In this project, ecological niche modeling was carried out for the lynx lynx species using R programming and fundamentally biomod2 package. 
* The current and future distribution projections of the species are included in the modelling. 
* Occurrence data of the species were obtained from GBIF website, distribution map from IUCN website, and current and future bioclimatic data from Worldclim's website. 
* Data could not be uploaded due to their large size.
* HTML-knitted version of Rmarkdown codes is also uploaded, so you can download Markdown.html file and check how the completed project looks.
